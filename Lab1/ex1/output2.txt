First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,
A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
But above and beyond there's still one name left over,
And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover -
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
